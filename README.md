# Assignment 1 303 
## Synopsis 
This program alters and controls an array of
integers. It can perfrom the following actions 
- Find the index of an integer 
- Modify the value of an integer at an index 
- Add a new integer to the end of the array 
- Replace or remove an integer at a specified index 

It does this by reading an array from an input file.

##Files
The program has two main files;
-303_Assignment1.cpp: This file is the main file that is used. It has all of the functions and the main line of code 
-headerfile.cpp: This file outlines all of the functions that are used in the program and clearly defines them with comments. 


## Functions 
This program has four main functions they are as followed

int findIndex
	- This function finds the index of an inyteger that the user selects. 
int modifyvalue 
	- This function finds the index of a value that is specified from the user and then allows you to change the value. Then it prints the old value and new value of the specified index. 
void addinttoarray 
	-This function is similar to a psuhback function in a vector as it adds an integer to the end of the array. Then it prints the full array. 
void replaceint 
	-This function eliminates a integer that is defined by an index that the user chooses.

	##Propper Usage 

- Once the user compiles the program it will ask for a an integer that you want to search for. Upon entering that integer it prints 
the index of that integer in the array. 
- Next it will ask what is the index of the value that you desire to replace. 
- Once the user inputs the index of that value then they will be asked what is the value that they want to replace it with. 
- The program will then print the old value and the new value.
- The function will then ask for you to add a new value to the end of the array. 
- The new array along with the new value will be printed
- Finally it will ask for the index of the number that the user wants removed. 
- It will print the whole array one more time without the index that the user specified present.
